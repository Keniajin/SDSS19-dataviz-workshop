# Data Visualization: Principles and Applications in R, Tableau, and Python -  8:00 a.m. â€“ 12:00 p.m. Wed. May 29th
*Instructor(s): Silas Bergen, Winona State University; Todd Iverson, Winona State University*
 
 ## Overview

In this course, participants will be introduced to principles of data visualization from foundational literature and implement these principles with hands-on activities using Tableau Public, Python (Altair), and R (ggplot). The course instructors have experience teaching these concepts and content as part of undergraduate statistics and data science curricula and will use example class projects from these courses.

The course will be divided into two modules. Module 1 will cover the principles of data visualization theory, summarizing and illustrating foundational data visualization literature. Module 2 will demonstrate how these principles are applied in various software platforms.

Hands-on data visualization tasks will be employed throughout. Participants must bring their own laptops.
