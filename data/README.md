## IPUMS data visualization task

The IPUMS data were aggregated from [IPUMS International](https://international.ipums.org/international/), and contain aggregated population counts by year, country, sex, and educational attainment.

Visualize the data!  Some questions to consider:

1. How have the education levels of the U.S. population changed (or not changed) over time?

2. Is the U.S. gender education gap widening or narrowing?

3. Which countries are the best-educated?

Can you answer Questions 1 and 2 with ***no aggregation or filtering*** (i.e., using all U.S. data rows)?
